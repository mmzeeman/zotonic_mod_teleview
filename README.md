# zotonic_mod_teleview

Mod teleview provides live updating server rendered views.

ðŸ“º

# Introduction

Teleview makes it possible to have server side rendered views, which update on the client. The communication
between the teleview and its client-side viewport is done via MQTT topics. Client side teleview viewports 
subscribe to a renderer, the renderer sends a video like update stream which allows the viewport to gradually
update its part of the dom-tree.

# Design

## MQTT Topics

#### `model/teleview/get/topics/<id>`

Topic used to retrieve the render topics from the teleview with the given `<id>`. The selection is handled by a
`z_teleview_state` process. This process selects the right renderer based on the language and/or acl settings of
the user.

#### `model/liveview/event/<id>/<renderer-ref>/+(patch_type)`

The topic on which a renderer broadcasts its update.

| patch_type | description                       |
| -----------| --------------------------------- |
| keyframe   | A complete rendered scene.         |
| idiff      | A diff against the last keyframe. |
| cdiff      | A diff against the last frame.     |

##### `keyframe`

```javascript
{
    ts: <timestamp>,
    keyframe: <text>
}
```

##### `idiff`

```javascript
{
    ts: <timestamp>,
    idiff: <patch>
}
```

##### `cdiff`

```javascript
{
    ts: <timestamp>,
    cdiff: <patch>
}
```

## Supervision Tree

The teleview zotonic module is a supervisor. It can start televiews. Televiews are a process which manages
the state, and a collection of renderers. The renderers take care of producing a render. Each renderer can 
have its own ACL and language settings. The state process selects the right renderer for the client side of
the teleview.
